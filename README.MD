These are the general functions for HLI projects. This allows us to keep the functions we use over and over again in the same place, so we don't have to copy them every time. Thereby, only one script needs to be edited to update these functions.

To load in your R script use:
```{r}
devtools::source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Karakaii/grid_approximation/main/grid_approximation.R")
```
